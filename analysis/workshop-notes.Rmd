# Description

Description from <https://www.sra.org/events-webinars/annual-meeting/program/annual-meeting-workshops/>:

**Workshop #7: Full Day 8AM-5PM** | Monte Carlo simulation and probability bounds analysis in R with hardly any data (Instructors: Ferson & Grey)

* Features hands-on examples worked in R on your own laptap, from raw data to final decision.
* Introduces and compares Monte Carlo simulation and probability bounds analysis for developing probabilistic risk analyses when little or no empirical data are available.
* You can use your laptop to work the examples, or just follow along if you prefer.
* The examples illustrate the basic problems risk analysts face: not having much data to estimate inputs, not knowing the distribution shapes, not knowing their correlations, and not even being sure about the model form.
* Monte Carlo models will be parameterized using the method of matching moments and other common strategies.
* Probability bounds will be developed from both large and small data sets, from data with non-negligible measurement uncertainty, and from published summaries that lack data altogether.
* Explains how to avoid common pitfalls in risk analyses, including the multiple instantiation problem, unjustified independence assumptions, repeated variable problem, and what to do when thereâ€™s little or no data.
* The numerical examples will be developed into fully probabilistic estimates useful for quantitative decisions and other risk-informed planning.
* Emphasis will be placed on the interpretation of results and on how defensible decisions can be made even when little information is available.
* The presentation style will be casual and interactive.
* Participants will receive handouts of the slides and electronic files with software for the examples.
